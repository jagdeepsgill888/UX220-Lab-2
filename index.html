        <p>Last term, I made a mental note that I would read some of the UX resources this summer. I read the Human
            Interface Guidelines from Apple, which talks about best practices In UX for Apple products.</p>
        <p>I learned about different types of patterns, components, gestures, screen sizes, input methods, and much more
            in Apple's design guideline</p>
